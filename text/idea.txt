I saw a Twitter post about a web app that had all the Chipotle locations and associated ratings with said Chipotle's

I want to add on to this idea and build almost a social media platform where people can post pictures live of their portions as well as if the Chipotle had everything they were looking for

Basically the Instagram of Chipotle

Thinking about getting Chipotle? Check the live feed to see if the portions are looking good!

Add Ons -
    Ratings of Portions
    Ratings of Staff
    Whether they were missing some component of your bowl
    Line Length
    *Check if Chipotle currently has a deal going on that would grant a free upgrade of some kind*

Problems:
    We need to scrape all the locations of Chipotle and store them into a Database so we can easily access them from within the API call
    Chipotle has all of these locations listed @ 
    https://locations.chipotle.com/
    TO BUY THIS DATA IS $95 DOLLARS, WTF, ONCE WE GATHER THIS FROM SCRAPING THE CHIPOTLE WEBSITE WE WILL PUBLISH THE DATASET ON GITHUB 
    https://www.scrapehero.com/store/product/chipotle-store-locations-in-the-usa/

    When we scrape the data on locations of Chipotle we will need to convert the addresses to long and lat values for the API to return, again storing this in the DB

Today we will start the journey of gathering the Chipotle location data with the help of a webscraper!
The goal is to gather important information about the Chipotle, including: State, City, Address, and Phone number
We can then use this information to get the longitude and latitude values of the location so we can plot the information on our map!

With the Chipotle data gathered and stored in a CSV now it is time to get it loaded onto a map!
With the latitude and longitude values I just need to make an API endpoint where the data can be grabbed from for the web app

Wanted to do more with the actual ratings system today, but got side tracked by doing more data cleaning
I think the data is completely clean now (no more address==name shenanigans), took a lot of time to get a good way to rename the Chipotles
The, hopefully final, cleaned dataset that we are now using is cleaned_chipotle_locations_v2.csv
I also added in the modal for when you click on a location as well as disabling other controls when the modal is up using a map overlay
The modal is very basic as of now and doesn't look great but it is a good start!
