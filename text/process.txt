How to test and develop the code:

1. Start the Node server for the API in a separate terminal by running "node .\server.js", this will allow the map to viewed locally
    (No longer need to do this, all the data is being served throught the database)

2. Start the Node server for the PostgreSQL16 Database in a separate terminal by running "node .\database.js", this will allow for you to post reviews

3. Open the preview of index.html and pop it out to the browser to use inspect element

4. Write code and make changes and view them live!
